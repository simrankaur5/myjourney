            <p>My name is Simran Kaur. I was born in the month of December in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwanza" target = "_blank"> Mwanza</a> which is a city in Tanzania, East Africa. I am currently studying for a degree in Computer Science at Goldsmiths, University Of London. <br>
            
            <p>Work Experience<br> Working life in Tanzania is considered as an adult's task. Students never look for a job unless they are graduated or if they do not wish to continue studying. On the other hand, looking for jobs in Mwanza was difficult as it was a small city and it was not highly developed economically. However when I moved to London I was amazed by the job opportunities students had while studying to enhance their experience in the practical and working world. Many students work part time whilst studying and students in year 10 get an opportunity to do work experience for 4 weeks. This strengthens their CV for future employment.</p>
            
            <p>When I was in year 10, I had the opportunity to do work experience. I worked as a trainee receptionist at Gilroy Court Hotel, Croydon. I found this as a useful experience because it was my first time ever in the working world and I had gained invaluable skills which included and were not limited to communication, time management and problem solving skills. I then experienced working at Battersea Pharmacy whilst studying in year 13. This again was a wonderful opportunity for me to enhance the skills I had acquired and learn new skills.</p>

I was very pleased and also excited to start this new job. I have since had many different experiences as I get to meet people from around the world who belong to different cultures, religions and ethnicities everytime I go to work. </p>

I successfully passed my GCSE exams in 2014 and I joined into Sixth form in the same school. In September 2015 when I was in year 13, I applied for further education at University for September 2016. As I studied Maths, English, Biology and Chemistry at A Levels, I thought of studying a science related course at University. After doing some research I found 2 courses that offered great potential and were courses I was interested in since secondary school. I decided to apply for Pharmacy as I had experience working at a Pharmacy during my summer holidays.  Year 13 was the most stressful year throughout my education experience since 2000.

At this point I was stressed and worried however I had to do something. I started calling Universities through the clearing process. I then got an offer from Goldsmiths University of London to study Computer Science. This was the second course I had decided to study while doing my research.

            <p class = "mediaeducation">In Tanzania failing an exam or even a class test was taken into account which meant being punished with sticks! If a student scored below 30% it was considered as failing and so the student would be disciplined with a punishement of sticks on the palm of their hand! This was not just to do with failing exams or tests but making noise in the class or disrespecting a teacher was taken into consideration. This clearly was done so that students studied hard and also stayed disciplined <br> I have experienced being punished with sticks however I was a disciplined student and liked by my teachers. I experienced this form of punishment on two instances, once when the whole class was making noise and another time was when I scored low marks in a Maths test. It was painful but I feel it did help me study hard for future class tests however getting beaten because of the class making noise was never justified.</p>

I found it very difficult for the first few months as I had never been on public transport since I moved to London. The buses were always packed with school children and sometimes the people on the buses were quite rude and unpolite as they would push into me or try to squeeze in even though there was no space! This experience on the public transport did put me off but I got accustomed to the morning and evening chaos on the buses after a while.</p>

                <p class = "mediaeducation">We had physical activities as part of the school curriculum similar to Tanzania. However unlike Tanzania, we had indoor sports because of the unpredictable weather in London. We played competitive games where all the class could take part. Some of the games were basketball, netball, badminton, table tennis and dodge ball. During summer we did have outdoor activities.</p>

As Tanzania is known for its natural beauty there are many local attractions around Mwanza City.<br> Firstly the "famous icon of the city - featuring in many photos for both locals and tourists" the Bismarck Rock which is in Lake Victoria. There were walking paths around the lake with restaurants and this place was named the "lakeside" by the locals. We would go to the lakeside every Sunday evening to have ice cream and take in the fresh air. Click on the image for more information.</p>

During my school holidays my family and our friends would go to the National Park for 3 - 4 days. We would drive to and from Serengeti with several breaks in between. We would stay at <a href="http://www.serengetiexpedition.com/hotel/protea" target = "_blank">Kijereshi Tented Camp</a> which was on the way to Serengeti National Park that provided accomodation and restaurants for tourists. There are driving paths through the national park and the animals can be seen in their natural habitat. I have seen many animals and birds at the national park which included giraffes, lions, buffaloes, zebras, monkeys, crocodiles and elephants. Serengeti National Park was my favourite holiday destination. Click on the image for more information.</p>

We would go to the island by boat which was the most convenient way of getting to the island and spend a whole day.

So, my family and I went on a holiday to Lake district, Cumbria for 5 days. The views and natural scenery were stunning. We stayed in a caravan in Silloth and travelled around the area. Some places we visited were the Lake District National Park, Keswick Lake cruise and Maryport. This was a breathtaking experience because  we were surrounded by mountain and highland views wherever we went. Click on the image for more information.</p>

London is the capital city of England and is known for its multi-culture and man-made attractive places. I went to Central London and I saw and experienced some of the famous tourist attractions: the Buckingam Palace, the London Eye, Big Ben, Hop-On Hop-Off Bus tour, the River Thames cruise and Victoria and Albert Museum. These were beautiful attractions to visit and it was quite a different experience to Tanzania where one can enjoy natural scenery and unspoilt views as attractions for tourists.

I lived and grew up in a house surrounded by a community so since my childhood I have learnt to communicate and interact with my neighbours and community. When I moved to London, I noticed that almost everyone is busy with their own lives and even though everyone has neighbours it is rare to see each other or even know one another but in Tanzania I would see my neighbours on a regular basis. This was a bit odd for me when I came to London but I understand this behaviour now since I too have become so busy and captured in the fast pace of life.</p>
