        My website is about my journey from Tanzania to London. I was born in Tanzania and I moved to London in 2011. I therefore thought of choosing this topic so I could share my experience of living in these 2 countries. I chose to make a parallax website because it is an interesting way of showing a continuous story and it looks attractive. Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. I tried to put a similar scrolling effect in my website as the <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Grenfell_21st_floor" target = "_blank"> Grenfell Tower website</a> because I liked the effect it had. I was also inspired by the layout of <a href = "http://www.garysheng.com/" target = "_blank"> Gary Sheng's website</a> because of the continuous flow his website has to show his life experiences. In addition I did some more research to get different ideas for the layout of my website. The <a href = "https://www.websitedevelopment.ltd.uk/#work" target = "_blank">website development</a> inspired me as it had various examples that gave me brilliant ideas to use in my website. The way I have made my website accessible is by using headings, subheadings and paragraphs with different font-sizes throughout to distinguish between the content so that the reader can read and understand the text easily. I have also used the 'alt' attribute to describe my images in my gallery just incase the images cannot be displayed or the user cannot view the images for example, if the user uses a screen reader. Some users may be visually impaired for example, people who are colour blind so I have used neutral colours throughout my website and I have avoided flickering and flashing effects as this may be distrubing to some users.<br> I have considered usability in my website because I have used the same layout throughout my pages so that it is easier for the user to navigate through the pages because the user will not have to adapt to changes everytime. I have created hyperlinks for some words to give extra information about them in my website I have ensured that they are underlined and they are a different colour to other text. This will help the users accessing my website to know that they can click on the word to read more information about it. I have ensured that my website is dramatic and interesting for the user and I have ensured that one section relates to the next section so that they keep on reading. I have done this by using parallax scrolling so the user can continue scrolling as they are reading and they do not need to click on buttons, tabs or links to go to the next page. <br> I had to learn and research new techniques and tools independently when creating my website. I had to learn and understand the parallax scrolling technique this was by using the w3schools website where I followed their explanation with the step by step examples  given inorder to create my parallax website. I learned that I had to use  the "div" tag with which I made sections for each page and separating the text from the images. In my website I have an image of the map showing the distance from Tanzania to London. I made it interactive by adding an aeroplane icon on each country and appling a "click" method that opens a dialogue box with some interesting facts about these two countries. After using the "map" tag the aeroplane's were not clickable anymore. I then researched and found a similar technique someone had used so I downloaded their files and plug-ins and put it in my work. I went through their code and adjusted it to make it work accordingly in my website so that when the user clicks on an aeroplane it would open the dialogue box.  I used the "map" tag which can be used in images to make clickable areas. I did not know about this technique until I researched and saw the examples in the w3schools website where I also had to learn the keywords to make it work in my website. It was difficult to adjust the coordinates for some shapes. After trial and error I managed to use the 'circle' shape. I learnt the CSS and the JS used to make the slideshow gallery for my photos in my website when I researched about it on the w3schools website because I had to apply similar techniques using my photos. <br> Overall I have managed to make my website the way I wanted it to look and behave. My idea of having a image of the map and being able to click on it and open a dialogue box worked well because of the different techniques I was able to use from the w3schools website and by researching on the internet. Secondly, I am pleased with the parallax scrolling effect I was able to implement in my website after learning the technique from w3schools. <br> My work could be improved because it does not have a menu navigation bar this is because it has a parallax scrolling effect so I had decided to not put a menu bar otherwise the parallax scrolling would not have been as effective as I wanted it to be. On reflection I might do things differently another time to make my website more user friendly. I would put a menu navigation bar as there are many different ways of doing it such as a fixed menu or a menu icon or even a off-canvas menu would be a good idea. Furthermore, I have used "media query" throughout my website to adjust the pages when the device screen is changed i.e mobile phone. I might do things differently another time by using "bootstrap" which would have been an easier and ideal way to adjust my website according to the screen size. On reflection, the idea of having a dialogue box show when an aeroplane is clicked does not work when the screen size is changed i.e mobile phones and this is because the coordinates of the aeroplane icon change. I might do things differently another time by making this idea work on any screen size and the possible solution could be putting in coordinates for every screen size using "media query".
